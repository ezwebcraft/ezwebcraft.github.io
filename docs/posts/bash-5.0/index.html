                <p>Hello power users, the fifth release of bash is focused on new shell variables and with a lot of significant bug fixes which is fantastic!!!

<p>comments from the mailing list</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This release fixes several outstanding bugs in bash-4.4 and introduces several new features. The most significant bug fixes are an overhaul of how nameref variables resolve and a number of potential out-of-bounds memory errors discovered via fuzzing. There are a number of changes to the expansion of <code>$@</code> and <code>$*</code> in various contexts where word splitting is not performed to conform to a Posix standard interpretation, and additional changes to resolve corner cases for Posix conformance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are the large amount cool feature added to powerful shell</p>
<h3 id="directly-from-the-mailing-list">Directly from the mailing list</h3>
<ol>
<li>New Features in Bash</li>
</ol>
<p>a. The <code>wait</code> builtin can now wait for the last process substitution created.</p>
<p>b. There is an EPOCHSECONDS variable, which expands to the time in seconds
since the Unix epoch.</p>
<p>c. There is an EPOCHREALTIME variable, which expands to the time in seconds
since the Unix epoch with microsecond granularity.</p>
<p>d. New loadable builtins: rm, stat, fdflags.</p>
<p>e. <code>BASH_ARGV0</code>: a new variable that expands to $0 and sets $0 on assignment.</p>
<p>f. When supplied a numeric argument, the shell-expand-line bindable readline
command does not perform quote removal and suppresses command and process
substitution.</p>
<p>g. <code>history -d</code> understands negative arguments: negative arguments offset from
the end of the history list.</p>
<p>h. The <code>name</code> argument to the <code>coproc</code> reserved word now undergoes word
expansion, so unique coprocs can be created in loops.</p>
<p>i. A nameref name resolution loop in a function now resolves to a variable by
that name in the global scope.</p>
<p>j. The <code>wait</code> builtin now has a <code>-f</code> option, which signfies to wait until the
specified job or process terminates, instead of waiting until it changes
state.</p>
<p>k. There is a define in config-top.h that allows the shell to use a static
value for <code>$PATH</code>, overriding whatever is in the environment at startup, for
use by the restricted shell.</p>
<p>l. Process substitution does not inherit the <code>v</code> option, like command
substitution.</p>
<p>m. If a non-interactive shell with job control enabled detects that a foreground
job died due to <code>SIGINT</code>, it acts as if it received the <code>SIGINT</code>.</p>
<p>n. The <code>SIGCHLD</code> trap is run once for each exiting child process even if job
control is not enabled when the shell is in Posix mode.</p>
<p>o. A new shopt option: <code>localvar_inherit</code>; if set, a local variable inherits the
value of a variable with the same name at the nearest preceding scope.</p>
<p>p. <code>bind -r</code> now checks whether a key sequence is bound before binding it to
NULL, to avoid creating keymaps for a multi-key sequence.</p>
<p>q. A numeric argument to the line editing <code>operate-and-get-next</code> command
specifies which history entry to use.</p>
<p>r. The positional parameters are now assigned before running the shell startup
files, so startup files can use address@hidden</p>
<p>s. There is a compile-time option that forces the shell to disable the check
for an inherited OLDPWD being a directory.</p>
<p>t. The <code>history</code> builtin can now delete ranges of history entries using
<code>-d start-end</code>.</p>
<p>u. The <code>vi-edit-and-execute-command</code> bindable readline command now puts readline
back in vi insertion mode after executing commands from the edited file.</p>
<p>v. The command completion code now matches aliases and shell function names
case-insensitively if the readline completion-ignore-case variable is set.</p>
<p>w. There is a new <code>assoc_expand_once</code> shell option that attempts to expand
associative array subscripts only once.</p>
<p>x. The shell only sets up <code>BASH_ARGV</code> and <code>BASH_ARGC</code> at startup if extended
debugging mode is active. The old behavior of unconditionally setting them
is available as part of the shell compatibility options.</p>
<p>y. The <code>umask</code> builtin now allows modes and masks greater than octal 777.</p>
<p>z. The <code>times</code> builtin now honors the current locale when printing a decimal
point.</p>
<p>aa. There is a new (disabled by default, undocumented) shell option to enable and disable sending history to syslog at runtime.</p>
<p>bb. Bash no longer allows variable assignments preceding a special builtin that changes variable attributes to propagate back to the calling environment unless the compatibility level is 44 or lower.</p>
<p>cc. You can set the default value for $HISTSIZE at build time in config-top.h.</p>
<p>dd. The <code>complete</code> builtin now accepts a <code>-I</code> option that applies the completion to the initial word on the line.</p>
<p>ee.  The internal bash malloc now uses mmap (if available) to satisfy requests greater than 128K bytes, so free can use mfree to return the pages to the kernel.</p>
<p>ff. The shell doesn&rsquo;t automatically set <code>BASH_ARGC</code> and <code>BASH_ARGV</code> at startup unless it&rsquo;s in debugging mode, as the documentation has always said, but will dynamically create them if a script references them at the top level without having enabled debugging mode.</p>
<p>gg. The <code>localvar_inherit</code> option will not attempt to inherit a value from a variable of an incompatible type (indexed vs. associative arrays, for example).</p>
<p>hh. The <code>globasciiranges</code> option is now enabled by default; it can be set to off by default at configuration time.</p>
<p>ii. Associative and indexed arrays now allow subscripts consisting solely of whitespace.</p>
<p>jj. <code>checkwinsize</code> is now enabled by default.</p>
<p>kk. The <code>localvar_unset</code> shopt option is now visible and documented.</p>
<p>ll. The <code>progcomp_alias</code> shopt option is now visible and documented.</p>
<p>mm. The signal name processing code now understands <code>SIGRTMIN+n</code>call the way up to SIGRTMAX.</p>
<p>nn. There is a new <code>seq</code> loadable builtin.</p>
<p>oo. Trap execution now honors the (internal) max invocations of <code>eval</code>, since traps are supposed to be executed as if using <code>eval</code>.</p>
<p>pp. The <code>$_</code> variable doesn&rsquo;t change when the shell executes a command that forks.</p>
<p>qq. The <code>kill</code> builtin now supports <code>-sSIGNAME</code> and <code>-nSIGNUM</code>, even though conforming applications aren&rsquo;t supposed to use them.</p>
<p>rr. POSIX mode now enables the <code>shift_verbose</code> option.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>New Features in Readline</li>
</ol>
<p>a. Non-incremental vi-mode search (<code>N</code>, <code>n</code>) can search for a shell pattern, as
Posix specifies (uses fnmatch(3) if available).</p>
<p>b. There are new <code>next-screen-line</code> and <code>previous-screen-line</code> bindable commands, which move the cursor to the same column in the next, or previous, physical line, respectively.</p>
<p>c. There are default key bindings for control-arrow-key key combinations.</p>
<p>d. A negative argument (-N) to <code>quoted-insert</code>  means to insert the next N characters using quoted-insert.</p>
<p>e. New public function: <code>rl_check_signals()</code>, which allows applications to respond to signals that readline catches while waiting for input using a custom read function.</p>
<p>f. There is new support for conditionally testing the readline version in an inputrc file, with a full set of arithmetic comparison operators available.</p>
<p>g. There is a simple variable comparison facility available for use within an inputrc file. Allowable operators are equality and inequality; string variables may be compared to a value; boolean variables must be compared to either <code>on</code> or <code>off</code>; variable names are separated from the operator by whitespace.</p>
<p>h. The history expansion library now understands command and process substitution and extended globbing and allows them to appear anywhere in a word.</p>
<p>i. The history library has a new variable that allows applications to set the initial quoting state, so quoting state can be inherited from a previous line.</p>
<p>j. Readline now allows application-defined keymap names; there is a new public function, <code>rl_set_keymap_name()</code>, to do that.</p>
<p>k. The &ldquo;Insert&rdquo; keypad key, if available, now puts readline into overwrite mode.</p>
<p>with a bundle of new improvement, fixes and feature it&rsquo;s a lot to cover on one news post, we will post a tutorial, use cases, and features soon.</p>
