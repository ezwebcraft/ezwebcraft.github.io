      <description>After dabblingly in a few programming languages like javascript, bash, and python, I finally biting the bullet and trying out C++, as low-level features and high-level abstraction, I figure this would boost my coding skills and get me closer into more development. So far, the language is not as scary as many make it be. Let touch on a few things on why C++ is good to learn.
First The Community The language itself has many followers, and many business use C++ for varies of reason.</description>

      <description>Regex&amp;rsquo;s some hate some love, but in the end, we all need something productive in our life. Some people hate because the mini-language can be arcane. Others love it because it adds superpowers for text processing. Learning the arcane secrets of regex can be a rough experience, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to.
so let do some exercises on regex like emails and IP for your everyday technical needs

      <description>So Linux Academy is offering a great course called Mastering Regular Expressions. After taking a few video course and video, I have to say learning more about regular expressions is more important than ever. Perhaps a few regexes (regular expressions) is fine for simple tasks, but for complex problems, having a deeper knowledge on many levels can boost your technical skill to a new level especially with the need for big data.</description>

      <description>Graphical tree of sub-directories This oneliner command is for a graphical tree of sub-directories, this is an excellent oneliner when you&amp;rsquo;re in need to view the directories in a graphical format. The tree is a recursive directory listing command or program that produces a depth indented listing of files which not generally found on all Linux or Unix systems. The first Tree Unix utility was developed by Steve Baker which includes a verbose of feature and flag option.</description>

      <description>The cat is known for reading files sequentially and display its output. it maybe be a simple command line tool, but it has many uses. cat is know a known tool throght the unix history and has been port over into GNU coreutils. One important factor about cat is that since because it does not require the files to consist of lines of text, but works with any sort of data.</description>

      <description>Hello, in shell echo &amp;quot;Hello World,&amp;quot;. Hello, fellow command line users. First I want to say thank you for visiting this site. This site is for anyone who enjoys working and using the command line aka shell. Soon we are going to add tutorials, talks, news, and man others thing about the command line for any who lives or loves using the command line. Gui is a great interface, but as we know the command line offers more precision and power than any other interface known to humans as this current state.</description>
