                    <div class="em">A great way to update docker images is to use this one-liner. Since, docker does not have a command; this command will update images that you have already pulled. The only way is to pull all images again using docker pull command. This simple one-liner can help you update all images at once.
docker images |grep -v REPOSITORY|awk '{print $1}'|xargs -L1 docker pull </div>

So far, the language is not as scary as many make it be. Let touch on a few things on why C++ is good to learn.
First The Community The language itself has many followers, and many business use C++ for varies of reason.</div>

With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts. Now in day scripting is mostly tie to automation. as I alway say, if you can type, you script it and finally you can automate. That why shell interface is so vital in today technology,</div>

                    <div class="em">In the shell piping, the stdout of a command into the stdin is a powerful technique in the terminal. But, what happens if you need to pipe the stdout of multiple commands, for example comparing and sort text data? Let use an example of where process substitution can be used.
example:
&lt;(list) or &gt;(list) Now let try view the lines unique to each of these two unsorted files with using process substitution.</div>
