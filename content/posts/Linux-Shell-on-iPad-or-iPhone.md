Hello Fellower Moles, thier is a great tools that haves a linux shell on moble devices.
The new Linux command line iSH app on iPad or iPhone. With iSH Shell is a Linux shell for iOS that uses an x86 emulator to run a simplified version of Alpine Linux on IOS. You can install packages and additional software directly into iSH with the Alpine package manager. 

Why Alpine Linux you say? Is a Linux distribution based on musl and BusyBox which many power users use, that want a light weight distro. Because of its small size, it's heavily used in containers providing quick a boot-up times, which makes a great choice for small userspace on IOS. To Install the iSH Shell into iOS requires TestFlight, which is a developer tool. 

The beauty of the shell is that is can be used on any device even on mobile. this is a great project called iSH in which you can run a container Linux on IOS is a great example. This is an excellent project that will open the doors for many users. We hope to see more of the shell get implements on more device.

check it out and give a trie on your IOS device.
